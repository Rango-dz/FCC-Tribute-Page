                <h2> Background</h2>
                <p>Very little is known about Boumédiène's life; even the year of his birth is contested. Most
                    sources state 1932 and Héliopolis as the date and place of his birth, but others say he was born
                    in Guelma on August 23, 1927, or Clauzel near Guelma on August 23, 1927, or August 16, 1925[3]
                    What is known with reasonable certainty of Boumedienne is that he was born in August 23 1932
                    near Guelma with the name of Mohammed Ben Brahim Boukharouba, and that his father was an
                    impoverished small wheat-farmer with seven children, an Arab and strict Muslim speaking no
                    French.[4][5] According to the Encyclopaedia of Islam, his family is Arabic speaking of Berber
                    origins.</p>
                <p>
                    He was educated at the Islamic Institute in Constantine. He joined the National Liberation Front
                    (FLN) in the Algerian War of Independence in 1955, adopting Houari Boumédiène as his
                    nom-de-guerre (from Sidi Boumediène, the name of the patron saint of the city of Tlemcen in
                    western Algeria, where he served as an officer during the war, and Sidi El Houari, the patron
                    saint of nearby Oran). He reached the rank of colonel, then the highest rank in the FLN forces,
                    and from 1960 he was chief of staff of the ALN, the FLN's military wing.

                    He was married to Anissa al-Mansali.

                <h2>After independence</h2>
                <p>
                    Boumédiène meeting with Algerian nationalist, Abdelhafid Boussouf
                    In 1961, after its vote of self-determination, Algeria declared independence and the French
                    announced it was independent. Boumédiène headed a powerful military faction within the
                    government, and was made defence minister by the Algerian leader Ahmed Ben Bella, whose ascent
                    to power he had assisted as chief of staff. Boumédiène was also appointed as Vice President of
                    Algeria in September 1963.[7] He grew increasingly distrustful of Ben Bella's erratic style of
                    government and ideological puritanism, and in June 1965, Boumédiène seized power in a bloodless
                    coup.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The country's constitution and political institutions were abolished, and he ruled through a
                    Revolutionary Council of his own mostly military supporters. Many of them had been his
                    companions during the war years, when he was based around the Moroccan border town of Oujda,
                    which caused analysts to speak of the "Oujda Group". One prominent member of this circle was
                    Boumédiène's long-time foreign minister, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who served as Algeria's president
                    from 1999 until 2019.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Initially, he was seen as potentially a weak leader, with no significant power base except
                    inside the army, and it was not known to what extent he commanded the officer corps. He remained
                    Algeria's undisputed leader until his death in 1978. No significant internal challenges emerged
                    from inside the government after the 1967 coup attempt.

                <h2>Domestic policy</h2>
                <p>
                    File:Algerian Economy 1972.ogv
                    1972 newsreel about Algeria under Boumédiène
                    Economically, Boumédiène turned away from Ben Bella's focus on rural Algeria and experiments in
                    socialist cooperative businesses (l'autogestion). Instead, he opted for a more systematic and
                    planned programme of state-driven industrialization. Algeria had virtually no advanced
                    production at the time, but in 1971 Boumédiène nationalized the Algerian oil industry,
                    increasing government revenue tremendously (and sparking intense protest from the French
                    government). He then put the soaring oil and gas resources—enhanced by the oil price shock of
                    1973—into building heavy industry, hoping to make Algeria the Maghreb's industrial centre. His
                    years in power were in fact marked by a reliable and consistent economic growth, but after his
                    death, in the 1980s, the drop in oil prices and increasingly evident inefficiency of the
                    country's state-run industries, prompted a change in policy towards gradual economical
                    liberalization.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In the 1970s, along with the expansion of state industry and oil nationalization, Boumédiène
                    declared a series of socialist revolutions, and strengthened the leftist aspect of his
                    administration. A side-effect of this was the rapprochement with the hitherto suppressed
                    remnants of the Algerian Communist Party (the PAGS), whose members were now co-opted into the
                    government, where it gained some limited intellectual influence, although without formal
                    legalization of their party. Algeria formally remained a single-party state under the FLN.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Political stability reigned, however, as attempts at challenging the state were generally nipped
                    in the bud. As chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council, Boumédiène and his associates
                    ruled by decree. During the 1970s, constitutional rule was gradually reinstated and civilian
                    political institutions were restored and reorganized. Efforts were made to revive activity
                    within the FLN, and state institutions were reestablished systematically, starting with local
                    assemblies and moving up through regional assemblies to the national level, with the election of
                    a parliament. The process culminated with the adoption of a constitution (1976) that laid down
                    Algeria's political structure. This was preceded by a period of relatively open debate on the
                    merits of the government-backed proposal, although the constitution itself was then adopted in a
                    state-controlled referendum with no major changes. The constitution reintroduced the office of
                    president, which Boumédiène entered after a single-candidate referendum in 1978.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the time of his death, later that year, the political and constitutional order in Algeria was
                    virtually entirely of FLN design. This structure remained largely unchanged until the late
                    1980s, when political pluralism was introduced and the FLN lost its role as dominant single
                    party. (Many basic aspects of this system and the Boumédiène-era constitution are still in
                    place.) However, throughout Boumédiène's era, the military remained the dominant force in the
                    country's politics, and military influence permeated civilian institutions such as the FLN,
                    parliament and government, undercutting the constitutionalization of the country's politics.
                    Intense financial or political rivalries between military and political factions persisted, and
                    was kept in check and prevented from destabilizing the government mainly by Boumédiène's
                    overwhelming personal dominance of both the civilian and military sphere.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Algeria is experiencing significant economic and social development under its government.
                    Between 1962 and 1982, the Algerian population increased from 10 to 20 million people and,
                    massively rural before independence, 45% of the population was urbanized. Annual per capita
                    income, which did not exceed 2,000 francs in 1962, exceeds 11,000 francs twenty years later,
                    while the enrolment rate varies from 75 to 95% depending on the region, far from the 10% of
                    French Algeria. However, it maintains a one-party system and the priority given to industrial
                    development makes it neglect agriculture.</p>
                <p>
                    Boumédiène pursued a policy of non-alignment, maintaining good relations with both the communist
                    bloc and the capitalist nations, and promoting third-world cooperation. In the United Nations,
                    he called for a unity built on equal status for western and ex-colonial nations, and brought
                    about by a socialist-style change in political and trade relations. He sought to build a
                    powerful third world bloc through the Non-Aligned Movement, in which he became a prominent
                    figure. He unconditionally supported freedom fighters, justice and equality seekers. He offered
                    logistic assistance to anti-colonial movements and other militant groups across Africa and the
                    Arab world, including the PLO, ANC, SWAPO and other nations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A significant regional event was his 1975 pledge of support for Western Saharan
                    self-determination, admitting Sahrawi refugees and the Polisario Front national liberation
                    movement to Algerian territory, after Morocco and Mauritania claimed control over the territory.
                    This ended the possibility of mending relations with Morocco, already sour after the 1963 Sand
                    War, although there had been a modest thaw in relations during his first time in power. The
                    heightened Moroccan-Algerian rivalry and the still unsolved Western Sahara question became a
                    defining feature of Algerian foreign policy ever since and remains so today.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>Death</h2>
                <p> In 1978, his appearances became increasingly rare. After lingering in a coma for 39 days, he
                    died in Algiers of a rare blood disease, Waldenström's macroglobulinemia, following unsuccessful
                    treatment in Moscow. Rumors about his being assassinated or poisoned have surfaced occasionally
                    in Algerian politics, especially after two other participants of the 1975 Algiers Agreement
                    events, The Shah and his Minister of Court Asadollah Alam, also died of the same rare disease.
                    The death of Boumédiène left a power vacuum in Algeria which could not easily be filled; a
                    series of military conclaves eventually agreed to sidestep the competing left- and right-wing
                    contenders, and designate the highest-ranking military officer, Colonel Chadli Bendjedid, as a
                    compromise selection.[9] Still, factional intrigue mushroomed after Boumédiène's death, and no
                    Algerian president has since gained the same respect from the Algerians.
